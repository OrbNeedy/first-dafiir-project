This is a Bullet Hell made from scratch using Godot.
It's mainly an attempt at making a mock Bullet Hell Engine with the help of Godot for things such as graphics and exporting the project.

## Game Concept
The main concept of the game is a Horizontal Bullet Hell that can be played multiple times.

To do this, I decided on a Bullet Hell where you could go through different routes to meet different challenges depending on your location.

Every stage will be represented in the game by a node in a map, connected to other stages, and every stage will decide on a different challenge based on certain parameters, such as location and difficulty.

While some details of this concept are already decided in a game document, since the game's engine is still in an early phase, they are subject to change.
